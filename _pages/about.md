I am originally from West Jordan, Utah but am currently based in Phoenix, Arizona.

I enjoy traveling with my wife and eating all the yummy food we can find. When we aren't able to travel and eat new food, it is always fun to cook in the kitchen together. To try and balance out all the yummy food, I try to spend a little time running, playing soccer, and ultimate frisbee as often as I can.

I received a B.S. in Global Supply Chain Management from Brigham Young University, and I currently work as a spares planner and expeditor for Lam Research Corperation. I have previously worked various roles within the supply chain including: Supply planner, Buyer, Category Management Assistant, Supply Transition Project Manager, and Operations Planner.

I am currently a graduate student at Southern Methodist University pursuing a Master of Data Science Degree.
